Wordpress Case Study:
Development Models:
WordPress follows an open-source development model. The core software is maintained and developed by a community of volunteers and contributors from around the world. 
This collaborative approach allows anyone to participate in its development and improvement.

Licensing:
WordPress is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This open-source license ensures that anyone can use, modify, and distribute WordPress freely. 
Users have the freedom to customize their websites without restrictions imposed by proprietary software.

Mode of Funding:
WordPress is primarily funded through Automattic Inc., the company founded by WordPress’s co-creator, Matt Mullenweg. Automattic generates revenue through various avenues, 
including WordPress.com (a hosted version of WordPress), premium themes and plugins, advertising, and partnerships. These funds support the development and maintenance of the 
open-source WordPress project.

Commercial Use:
WordPress is widely used for commercial purposes. Many businesses and e-commerce websites leverage WordPress for their online presence. They often invest in premium themes, plugins, 
and hosting services to enhance their websites’ functionality and appearance. WordPress’s flexibility makes it a valuable tool for commercial ventures.

Non-Commercial Use:
WordPress also serves non-commercial purposes. Bloggers, hobbyists, educational institutions, and nonprofits use WordPress to create websites and share content without the need for 
significant financial investments. Its user-friendly interface and extensive plugin library make it accessible to a wide range of users.
